README file for emr-hbase-sample

This sample application reads genomic sequence files and creates an kmer index that is
stored in an HBASE table.  Genomic sequence information is growing exponentially and 
processing large fasta files is becoming problematic.  Hadoop and its related software
provide a scalable infrastructure for processing such large files.  This application
uses:
   - custom PIG UDF's to read sequence fasta files and generate kmer indexes
   - uses pig's builtin HBASE classes to store the index into hbase tables
   - uses Elastic Map Reduce for creating hadoop cluster and for job submission


Prerequisites

There is a makefile that drives the process, but it assumes that your AWS id and 
keys are defined in environment variables, that the aws-sdk is installed and that the
elastic-mapreduce library is also installed and configured.  


	- install aws-sdk
	- install elastic-mapreduce
	- makefile assumes s3cmd is also instaleld and configured

To Run

The makefile creates a new bucket in S3 and pushes all the required jars into that 
bucket.  then spins up an EMR cluster with the hbase beta.  Once running, it adds
a jobflow that generated the index.  

take a look at the makefile and feel free to adjust the input data files if needed.

	% make create   % creates the cluster
	% make index	% runs a jobflow that creates the index in hbase
	% make counts	% runs a jobflow that uses the index to caluclate kmer counts
	% make destroy 	% terminates the cluster and removes the s3 bucket.
